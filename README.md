# NEIGHBORHOOD MAP

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Installation

To install on your computer

1. Fork the neighborhood-map repo [GitHub Pages](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/).
2. `cd` into desired folder where you would like the file to live.
3. Using `git clone` copy the file on to your machine.
4. Once the repo is downloaded to your local machine, run `npm install`. This will install all the dependencies          needed for the project to run. Once the dependencies are installed, run `npm start`. Your browser should open a window to localhost:3000.

**Browser recommendation is Google Chrome.**

## Production Build Installation & Service Worker

Running in production mode will grant access to the service worker for caching and offline usage.

After the dependencies have installed, issue `npm run build` to your command-line interface. This will produce a minified, optimized version of the project. To start it up, run `serve -s build` and then navigate to http://localhost:5000.
